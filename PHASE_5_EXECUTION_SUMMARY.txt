# PHASE 5 EXECUTION COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Done

Phase 5 completed the Social Intelligence Tab remediation by removing all demo indicators and marking the feature as production-ready.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Demo Warning Banner**
   - Deleted the amber warning box with "Demo Data — Not Real Analytics"
   - Agents no longer see cautionary messages
   - Left only Phase 5 production-ready comment

2. **Updated Tab Navigation Label**
   - Changed from "Social Intelligence (Demo)" → "Social Intelligence"
   - Feature now identified as production, not experimental

3. **Updated Service Documentation**
   - Marked service as "PRODUCTION READY"
   - Listed all 6 real data sources in priority order
   - Updated comments throughout to reflect production status

4. **Changed Demo Fallback to Empty Data**
   - Replaced `generateStableDemo()` with empty sections (honest about availability)
   - No more fabricated numbers when data unavailable
   - If data missing, sections show 0 values (transparent)

5. **Updated Cache Strategy**
   - Real data: 12 hour cache TTL
   - Empty/incomplete data: 1 hour cache TTL (retry more frequently)

6. **Marked Deprecated Code**
   - `generateStableDemo()` marked as deprecated (Phase 5, no longer used)
   - Kept for rollback reference only

### Build Status
✅ **TypeScript: 0 errors**  
✅ **Vite Build: Success**  
✅ **All tests: Passed**
