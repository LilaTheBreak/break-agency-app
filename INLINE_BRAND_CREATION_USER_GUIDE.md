## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use consistent brand naming (e.g., always "Nike", not "NIKE" or "nike")
- Create brands when you need them (no separate step required)
- Check existing brands before creating (type first to search)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Create duplicate brands with different casing (system prevents this)
- Use special characters unnecessarily (though they're allowed)
- Wait for confirmation dialogs (creation is instant)

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I typed a brand name but don't see the "Create" option
**A:** The brand might already exist with different casing. Try:
- Type exactly as it appears in the list
- Or select the existing brand from the filtered list

### Q: The brand creation is slow
**A:** This usually takes < 2 seconds. If it's taking longer:
- Check your internet connection
- Try again (might be a temporary server issue)
- Contact support if it persists

### Q: I created a brand but it's not saving with my deal
**A:** 
- Make sure the brand is selected in the dropdown (should be highlighted)
- Check that you filled in all required fields (*marked with *)
- Try creating the deal again

### Q: I accidentally created a duplicate brand
**A:** Contact support - they can merge duplicates or delete if needed
