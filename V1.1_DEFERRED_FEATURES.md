# V1.1 Deferred Features List

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Features deferred to V1.2 or later

---

## Overview

This document lists features that were planned for V1.1 but intentionally deferred to future releases. These are not bugs or incomplete implementations - they are deliberate design decisions to maintain V1.1 scope.

---

## V1.1 Features Deferred to V1.2

### Platform Inboxes - Posting & Replying

**Deferred Features:**
- ❌ Posting to Instagram (read-only implemented)
- ❌ Replying to Instagram DMs (read-only implemented)
- ❌ Posting to TikTok (read-only implemented)
- ❌ Replying to TikTok messages (read-only implemented)
- ❌ WhatsApp messaging (placeholder only)

**Reason:** V1.1 scope was read-only inbox syncing. Posting/replying requires additional API permissions and complexity.

**Status:** Fully implemented read-only sync. Posting/replying deferred to V1.2.

---

### Xero Integration - Auto-Create Deals

**Deferred Feature:**
- ❌ Auto-create deals from Xero invoices

**Reason:** V1.1 scope was one-way sync (Break Agency → Xero). Auto-create would require two-way sync and deal matching logic.

**Status:** Invoice push/pull implemented. Auto-create deferred to V1.2.

---

### Notion Integration - Auto-Sync

**Deferred Feature:**
- ❌ Automatic sync on record updates
- ❌ Scheduled sync jobs
- ❌ Batch sync operations

**Reason:** V1.1 scope was manual sync triggers. Auto-sync requires background job infrastructure and conflict resolution.

**Status:** Manual sync implemented. Auto-sync deferred to V1.2.

---

### Google Drive Integration - Full OAuth

**Deferred Feature:**
- ❌ Full OAuth flow (currently manual token entry)
- ❌ OAuth callback handlers
- ❌ Automatic token refresh

**Reason:** V1.1 scope was file linking functionality. Full OAuth can be added later without breaking changes.

**Status:** File linking implemented. Full OAuth deferred to V1.2.

---

### Slack Integration - Rich Blocks

**Deferred Feature:**
- ❌ Rich Slack blocks (currently text-only)
- ❌ Interactive buttons
- ❌ Thread replies
- ❌ Channel selection UI

**Reason:** V1.1 scope was basic notifications. Rich blocks enhance UX but aren't required for core functionality.

**Status:** Text notifications implemented. Rich blocks deferred to V1.2.

## Deferred Feature Rationale

### Why These Features Were Deferred

1. **Scope Management:** V1.1 focused on core integrations, not advanced features
2. **Complexity:** Auto-sync, two-way sync, and posting require additional infrastructure
3. **User Feedback:** Better to ship core features and iterate based on usage
4. **Technical Debt:** Avoid over-engineering before validating core functionality

### When to Revisit

**V1.2 Planning Criteria:**
- User demand for deferred features
- Core V1.1 features proven stable
- Infrastructure ready for advanced features
- Clear ROI on development effort

---

## Implementation Notes

### For Future Developers

**When implementing deferred features:**

1. **Maintain Backward Compatibility:**
   - Don't break existing V1.1 functionality
   - Add new features as opt-in
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout

2. **Follow V1.1 Patterns:**
   - One-way sync first, then two-way
   - Manual triggers first, then auto-sync
   - Basic functionality first, then rich features

3. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Integration tests for external APIs
   - Error handling for network failures
   - Graceful degradation patterns

---

## Conclusion

V1.1 successfully delivered 6 major feature phases. Deferred features are documented and ready for V1.2 planning. All deferred features maintain the same quality standards and patterns established in V1.1.

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor V1.1 feature usage
2. Gather user feedback
3. Prioritize V1.2 features based on demand
4. Plan implementation timeline
